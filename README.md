# Notes
Notes app with Vue3 and Django

## Go to the frontend and backend folders in order to see how to run it locally

### Quick project while learning Vue3 and Django (Django REST)

### This is just the signup page

What this app can do:
1. Have your own notes account
2. Write any number ammount of notes for yourself
3. Save them, edit them and/or delete them

I used **Django REST because** i like it that way, authentication is done with **simple JWT** and ofcourse the site is **responsive and fast**
